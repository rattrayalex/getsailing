Time to get to work! All that installing and nothing to show for it. Let's get fired up. 

## tl;dr

1. Create a [new repo on Github](https://github.com/new). 
2. [Generate ssh-keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)
3. 
    ```sh 
    mkdir ~/code
    cd ~/code
    git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/firstproject.git
    ```

If the above looks scary/unfamiliar, read on. If you're yawning, hit the next chapter. 

## Create a Repository

(Repository? What's a Repository?? I don't think I'm smart enough for programming...)

There are a lot of fancy-sounding and scary-looking things when you learn anything new. Especially because learning to code is usually a solitary endeavor. I don't have anything helpful to say here other htan "don't be scared!" and "learn with a friend!". If you have no friends, or no friends who are interested in learning to code, ...you are not alone =) 

Alright, anyway, about that repository. A "repo", as we usually call them, is a place to share and store code. It's like a cubby for a group project in arts and crafts class! Fun!

We're going to create our Repo on Github. Github is like the greatest thing ever. If a repo is a cubby for a group project, Github is a *massive* wall with *millions* of cubbies, where anyone can borrow somebody else's colors or legos or even help them build that toothpick bridge.

Github is famous for those open-source repos, which are public - anyone in the world can see them, and even ask to help out. Github makes their money by selling *private* repo hosting: companies usually don't want all their code to be open-source. 

Today, we're going to create an open-source repository, partly because it's free. Yes, this means your mom or your future employer can see your code. That doesn't mean you should be nervous or embarassed. I *guarantee you* that even the fanciest of the fancy software companies will understand that we all start from somewhere. *Every single developer* worth their salt is embarrassed by their old code and they'll understand if they stumble accross this project. 

Without further ado, time to [sign up](https://github.com/join) if you haven't already! Next, [create that repo](https://github.com/new). I recommend the Repository name "firstproject". That's what I'll be using in my examples. In Description, you can put "following along to the Get Sailing book" if you wanna be nice to me =). I recommend initializing with a README, and add the gitignore for "Node". You can add an "MIT" license if you want - this basically means "anyone can do whatever they want with this code".

## Prepare the Landing Pad

Git is usually operated from the command line (aka Terminal). I'm going to cover usage that way. However, you can also skip this mucking about by downloading a desktop application like [Github for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [SourceTree](http://sourcetreeapp.com/). SourceTree is more powerful and made by a competitor to Github, but works just fine with Github repos. 

Before you can interact with github, you need to [generate ssh keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys), a scary and arcane process that will be over before you know it, and won't come up again for a long time. The github guide is really good; better than I had when I was your age! (note that those `$` signs indicate that something goes into the Terminal - don't copy them in!)

Okay, now that you've got ssh set up (whooh!), time to use it. 

First, we'll want a home for our code on our computers. I recommend putting all coding projects in the same folder, inside your "home" folder. For me, that's `/Users/alex/`. If your name is Yacintha, it might be `/Users/yacintha/`. You get the picture. In the terminal, this folder is represented by a convenient shortcut, the `~`. So your Desktop folder is located at `~/Desktop`, aka `/Users/yacintha/Desktop`. Let's create a `code` folder. You can do that in Finder the old-fashioned way, or in Terminal the cool way: 

```sh
mkdir ~/code
```

`mkdir` is a command which makes ("mk") a directory ("dir"). "Directory" is geek-speak for "Folder", and it's often shortened to "dir" (like, durrhhhh). We'll talk about directories a lot. 

One of the most common commands in the terminal is `cd`. `cd` stands for "Change Directory", aka "go to folder". To go into our shiny new code folder: 

```sh
cd ~
cd code
```

or just 

```sh
cd ~/code
```

To go up a level, use `..` 

```sh
cd ~/code
# /Users/yacintha/code
cd ..
# /Users/yacintha
cd code
```
Now you have superpowers!

## Download that Repository!

First, we'll need the URL to download. You can get that in the github page by clicking the little copy-to-clipboard button in the image: 

![Get the "SSH clone URL" text in the lower-right, below "Settings"](/images/ssh_clone.png)

It should look like this: `git@github.com:rattrayalex/firstproject.git`. 

Now, in Terminal, make sure you're in `~/code`, and write `git clone`, followed by that url. For me, that'd be: 

```sh
cd ~/code
git clone git@github.com:rattrayalex/firstproject.git
```

That'll create a folder in `~/code` called `firstproject`, which will be magically connected to your github repository. Let's go in there (`cd firstproject`).
<!--- and look around: 

```sh
ls
```

... There won't be much yet.

(`ls`, which I refer lovingly to as "List Shit", tells you what's inside of a directory. `pwd`, "Print Working Directory", tells you where you are). 

## Kick the Git Tires

Open up your `firstproject` folder in Sublime. Edit the README file - add some gibberish, say "Oh, just messin around", write an essay about bacon, whatever you wanna do. 

```sh
git add .
```
